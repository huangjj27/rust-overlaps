only needed if reversals are enabled.
For each input string, two unique text entries are appended, one forwards and one backwards.
The orientation of these strings corresponds with the parity of their ID's
(an internal representation of the strings) with NORMAL strings having EVEN IDs and REVERSED strings having ODD parity.
Note that this is "normal" and "reversed" considering the inverse reading direction of the index.
ie: given a string "XYZ", this will append the "normal" (ZYX) to the text with ID 0 and (XYZ) to the text with ID 1.

This function simply finds the ID of the strings with the given ID such that the two
strings are from the same input string, but lie in opposite directions
