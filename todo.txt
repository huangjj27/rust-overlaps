Filters are FORWARDS (Pattern has Suffix filters)
Search iterates over characters FORWARDS
---------the mapping from p_i --> pattern[?] is BACKWARDS (REVERSAL)-------

TODO:
	Convention: when to use usize etc.
	change the numeric types to avoid some casting.
	trim the fat with imports.

	remove self-cands in search step
	debug the direction of things

	does maps.get() for Vec<String> return the entire string? that would be bad.


TODO rustbio feedback:
	hamming returns u64, levenstein returns u32
